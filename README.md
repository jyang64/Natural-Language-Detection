## About

This program finds the frequency of a trigram (a sequence of three letters) occurring in a number of training languages, located in the training_languages directory. The frequency of each distict trigram is stored in a vector. An input file will be compared to the frequency vector of each training language using an algorithm. Test input files are located in the testing_languages directory.
